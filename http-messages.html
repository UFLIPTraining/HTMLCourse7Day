      <h2>HTML Error Messages</h2>
      <p>
        When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur, and the server might return an error code like "404 Not Found".
      </p>
      <p>
        It is common to name these errors HTML error messages. But these messages are something called HTTP status messages. In fact, the server always returns a message for every request. The most common message is 200 OK.
      </p>
      <p>Below is a list of HTTP status messages that might be returned:</p>
